Pain points:

1. feature undestanding (use cases)
2. test data
3. test expectations change over time, as a result tests break.
4. no dedicated qa/test environment
5. big monolithic test scripts
6. soap ui, not maintainable (is it the right tool?)
7. Repository unit tests





Solutions:

1.
	a. Uses cases documented (Sheena or Rose)
	b. Better acceptance criteria in Version One stories
	c. Include QA in all new feature discussions
	
2.
