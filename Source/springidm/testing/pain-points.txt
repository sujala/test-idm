Pain points:

1. feature undestanding (use cases)
2. test data
3. test expectations change over time, as a result tests break.
4. no dedicated qa/test environment
5. big monolithic test scripts
6. soap ui, not maintainable (is it the right tool?)
7. Repository unit tests
8. long deployments




Solutions:

1.
	a. Uses cases documented (Sheena or Rose)
	b. Better acceptance criteria in Version One stories
	c. Include QA in all new feature discussions
	
2.
	a. get dedicated cloud auth users for all environments
	b. get dedicated ga users for all environments

3.
	a. ci builds for all environments ~ in progress

4.	
	a. set up each environment with dedicated ldap server ~ in progress
	
5. 	a. create feature base modules
	b. fix delete from softDeleted call ~ DONE
	c. create and delete users within module (TEST CASE) ~ in progress

6.	a. do not use wadl to create tests
	b. research better tool
	
7. 	a. move repository test to ci build ~ DONE

8.	a. combine smoke test for all versions
