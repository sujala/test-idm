=======================================================
Story: Switch dev environments to use RSI docker images
=======================================================

Description
-----------

The RSI docker images are now ready to use. The first step to start switching the team over
to using these images is to switch the local dev environments over to use the images and
create the artifactory repository for these images.

Business Acceptance Criteria
----------------------------

1. Create the artifactory repository for artifacts built from the cloud-identity project.

2. Update the Jenkins jobs that build the RSI images to use the newly created artifactory repo.

3. Update the dev docker-compose file to use the RSI docker images.

    1. The images currently used and need to be ported over to the RSI equivalents are used are:

        1. docker.ciidentity.com/postfix

        2. docker.ciidentity.com/cloud-feeds

        3. docker.ciidentity.com/e-directory

        4. docker.ciidentity.com/ca-directory

        5. docker.ciidentity.com/repose

4. Document and demo the work done and any changes in use between the original docker images and the new RSI images.
