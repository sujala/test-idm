==============================================
Implement healthCheck on ldap connection pools
==============================================

Description
-----------

Currently there is no healthCheck implemented for unboundId
LdapConnectionPools. In order to process defunct connection a valid
health check must be done to determine the status of each LDAP node.
Work with Robert R. to implement a healthCheck which uses
the least expensive LDAP call to determine if a new connection is
valid or an existing connection is valid for continued use.

Methods to implement for LDAPConnectionPoolHealthCheck.

1. ensureNewConnectionValid
2. ensureConnectionValidForContinuedUse

With this story we'd like to solve the following issues:

1. Run a valid health check on LDAP connections.
2. Alleviate ops pains when flushing out LDAP nodes.

Business Acceptance Criteria
----------------------------
#. Implement LDAPConnectionPoolHealthCheck
#. Add feature flag to enable/disable health check functionality

Test Acceptance Criteria
------------------------
TBD
