===============================================
Allow a contactId to be set on a federated user
===============================================

Description
-----------
To support dedicated federation a **contactId** must be able to be set on a
federated user. The **contactId** can not be set as part of the SAML federation,
but must be done after the federated user is already created - an update of a
federated user. The only attribute that can be updated on a fed user is the
**contactId** and, similar to other attributes, the **contactId** can not be blanked
out once it is set to a value. If the update request for a federated user
includes a blank **contactId**, then the update is a no-op.

The update service should then return the federated user details similar to the
get user by ID for a federated user - including the **contactId**.

Implementation
--------------

Revamp identity's v2.0 update user call (v2.0/users/{userId}) to allow updating
federated users's **contactId**. The service must determine whether a user is
provisioned or federated. If the user is federated, the service must provide
following logic.

1. Maintain same permissions as for updating a **contactId** on a provisioned user.
 a) Users with role ``identity:service-admin``, or ``identity:admin`` are allowed to make this update.
2. Allow updating **RAX-AUTH:contactId** on federated users
 a) Validate **contactId** length is less than 64 characters.
   - Update the v2.0 create and update user calls to perform this validation
 b) If **contactId** is not provided, the service is just a no-op. Return 200 OK.
 c) Once the attribute is set, it cannot be blank out.
3. Any other attributes passed in the request are ignored.
4. Response must include same details as get user by ID.
5. Return 404 Not Found if the federated user is not found.
